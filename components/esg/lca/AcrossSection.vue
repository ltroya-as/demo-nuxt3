              Each Global LCA provides a <strong>detailed analysis</strong> on
              the <strong>environmental impacts</strong> of the dominant
              processing routes at present that demonstrates “average" LCA
              results for each mineral, allowing stakeholders to deepen their
              <strong>knowledge on environmental hotspots</strong> and potential
              areas of concern across the industry.
            </span>
            <span>
              Companies can use the Global LCA to make informed decisions on
              their operations through
              <strong>understanding common environmental challenges</strong> at
              facilities. Facilities, both in development and in operation can
              compare and measure their impacts against this live industry
              average, gaining insight into their performance against the
              baseline.

              Benchmark Global LCAs are <strong>ISO-compliant</strong> and are
              <strong>‘cradle-to-gate’</strong>: the ‘cradle’ starts at raw
              material acquisition, and the ‘gate’ marks the finished product as
              defined by the goal and scope.

              Benchmark Global LCAs are
              <strong>featured in each Benchmark ESG Report</strong>
              that covers the battery supply chain, updated quarterly to ensure
              all market changes and developments in technologies or processes
              are captured accurately.
