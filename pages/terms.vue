        of age, and such individuals are not permitted to be Registered Users or
        Subscribers. If individuals under eighteen (18) years of age wish to

        these Terms; (a) and (b) you are at least eighteen (18) years of age.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        4.3 You undertake that you will, and if you are a Subscriber, you will
        procure that any licensed user under your subscription will: (a) comply
        with all applicable laws in relation to the Sites and Services,
        including without limitation, laws relating to the use of Intellectual
        Property; (b) not use the Sites or the Content outside the scope of
        permitted use under Clause 3 above, nor infringe any Intellectual
        Property or other rights in or relating to the Site or the Services or

        disassemble, reverse engineer, upload, download, transmit, create
        derivative works from or otherwise exploit or tamper with any Site or,
        subject to Clause 14, any software embodied in any Site or Service; (d)

        users nor hack into or cause damage to any server or other equipment

      <p>
        4.4 You are responsible for procuring the necessary equipment and the
        payment of telephone, internet and other charges necessary to access
        and/or use any Site or Service. We are not responsible for the

      <p>
        4.5 Any Content sent for overseas delivery (including, without

        subject to import duties and taxes collected at the final destination.
        All sales or use taxes, import duties or additional customs charges must
        be borne entirely by you. We have no control over these charges and we
        expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for them. Customs
        policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your
        local customs office for further information. Additionally, when
        ordering from us, you are considered the importer of record and must
        comply with all law and regulations of the country in which you are
        receiving the goods. Our international customers should be aware that
        cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs
        authorities. We may provide certain order, delivery and product
        information (such as the product’s title) to our international carriers
        and such information may be communicated by the carriers to customs
        authorities in order to facilitate customs clearance and comply with
        local laws. If the order is a gift, the package will be marked ‘Gift’
        but the cost or value of the item may still be stated on the customs
        form and/or the package.

        particular subscription or other Service or reconfirming your order at
        the correct price.

        users on a network.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        6.6 To the extent that the terms of a multiple-user licence restricts

      <p><strong>7 SUBSCRIPTION CHARGES AND REFUND POLICY</strong></p>
      <br />
      <p
        >7.1 Subscribers must pay certain charges in order to receive the
        relevant subscription Service (unless we agree otherwise for a trial
        period). In most cases, details of applicable charges can be found on
        the specific Sites relating to the relevant subscription Service. Where
        charges are not published on a Site, the applicable charges will be as
        agreed between you and us. All payments (including any applicable taxes)
        must be made in any currency that we may specify. We may direct you to
        make payments to a third party payment agent. If we (or our designated
        agent) do not receive payment for any charges due, we may immediately
        suspend your rights in relation to the relevant Service (including any
        relevant Site and/or Content). You are responsible for the payment of
        all charges associated with the use of the Service, Site and/or Content
        using your user name and password.</p

        subscription charges you have paid in advance (for the relevant
        cancelled subscription) which relate to any unexpired part of the
        subscription period at the date of cancellation. You will still be
        responsible for any fees or other charges incurred by you until the
        cancellation of your rights in relation to the relevant subscription
        Service.

        refund on a pro rata basis of any subscription charges you have paid in
        advance for any complete months remaining of the subscription period at
        the date of cancellation beyond the Minimum Term; (b) we shall deduct
        from the refund due an administration fee of £100, US$150 or €150
        (depending on the relevant currency of payment); and (c) if you were
        granted any discount on the full value of the subscription charges for
        the subscription period, we may recalculate the value of the Minimum
        Minimum Term of the subscription period on the basis that no discount
        was applied to such Minimum Term.
